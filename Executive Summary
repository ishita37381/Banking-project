Business Context
In the rapidly evolving banking sector, understanding customer behavior and product performance across multiple dimensions such as relationship types, income bands, occupations, and nationality is crucial for strategizing personalized offerings, risk management, and portfolio growth. This dashboard enables the bank to identify:

Top contributing segments to deposits and loans

Patterns in account balances and lending

Customer segmentation for targeted strategies

Insights that can guide business decisions for product alignment and resource allocation

Data Sources & Methodology
Data Extraction & Cleaning (SQL):

Raw banking data was extracted and cleaned using SQL queries.

Data aggregation was performed to summarize total deposits, loans, account balances, and customer profiles.

Missing values and outliers were identified and handled through SQL and Python preprocessing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (Python - Jupyter Notebook):

Performed detailed EDA to uncover patterns and correlations among key variables.

Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Segmentation was done based on Banking Relationship (Commercial, Private, Retail, Institutional), Gender, Income Band, Occupation, Nationality, and Year of Joining.

Dashboard Development (Power BI):

Built a user-friendly and dynamic dashboard allowing stakeholders to interactively filter data and view insights.

Two main analysis pages were created:

Deposit Analysis Dashboard

Loan Analysis Dashboard

KPI cards, bar charts, and donut charts were used for visual storytelling.
