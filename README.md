Banking Domain Data Analysis & Dashboard Project
üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on Banking Domain Data Analysis where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL, Python (Jupyter Notebook), and developed an interactive Power BI Dashboard. The goal is to derive insights from banking data involving deposits, loans, customer relationships, and visualize them in an intuitive way for business understanding and decision-making.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
SQL: Data extraction, transformation, and querying.

Python (Jupyter Notebook): EDA, data cleaning, and statistical analysis.

Power BI: Interactive dashboards & data visualization.

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Python libraries).

üìà Key Features & Insights
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed banking relationships (Commercial, Private, Retail, Institutional).

Customer segmentation by Income Bands, Gender, Year of Joining, Occupation, and Nationality.

Identified trends in Deposit & Loan amounts, Savings & Checking Accounts, and Credit Card Balances.

Outliers, missing data handling, and feature correlations using Python.

2. Power BI Dashboard
Created interactive dashboards with filters (Gender, Year of Joining, Banking Relationship).

Separate Loan Analysis and Deposit Analysis pages with visual insights.

Top contributing segments by Occupation, Income Bands, and Banking Relationships.

Visuals include:

KPI Cards (Total Deposits, Loans, Accounts)

Bar Charts (Top Occupations, Bank Deposits by Branch)

Pie/Donut Charts (Income Band Distributions)

3. SQL Analysis
Wrote SQL queries to summarize total deposits, loans, and account balances.

Data aggregation and joins for customer profiling.

Cleaned and prepared data for Power BI consumption.

üîë Key Takeaways
Demonstrated integration of SQL, Python, and Power BI for end-to-end data analysis.

Delivered business-centric insights like which occupations contribute most to deposits and loans, relationship-based segmentation, and nationality/income-driven trends.

Created a professional and interactive Banking Dashboard to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
